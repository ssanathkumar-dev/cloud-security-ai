# AI-Powered Cloud Security Monitoring System

##  Introduction
Cyber attacks are becoming more frequent and complex, making traditional rule-based detection systems insufficient.  
This project aims to build an **AI-powered cloud-based security monitoring system** that can detect suspicious activities in system and network logs in real-time.  
It combines three domains:
- **Cloud Computing** → For scalable log storage and deployment of the monitoring system.  
- **Cyber Security** → For analyzing logs, detecting threats, and protecting cloud infrastructure.  
- **Artificial Intelligence / Machine Learning** → For anomaly detection, classification of attacks, and predictive analysis.  

##  Objectives
- Collect and preprocess system and network logs from multiple sources.  
- Develop **Machine Learning models** (e.g., Isolation Forest, Random Forest, Deep Learning) to detect anomalies.  
- Create an **interactive dashboard** to visualize attacks and suspicious activities.  
- Deploy the system on **cloud infrastructure (AWS/GCP)** for real-time monitoring.  
- Enhance security with **real-time alerts** for brute-force, unusual login attempts, or abnormal network traffic.  
- Document the system with clear steps so it can be reproduced and improved by others.  

##  Tech Stack (Planned)
- **Programming**: Python  
- **ML/AI Libraries**: scikit-learn, pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn  
- **Dashboard**: Streamlit / Flask  
- **Cloud**: AWS EC2 / GCP Cloud Run, S3/Cloud Storage  
- **Security Logs**: Linux auth logs, Apache logs, public datasets (UNSW-NB15, CICIDS 2017)
